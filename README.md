# MLOps_project

This repository contains the group project work for the MLOps course at LMU Munich. 


**1 Overall goal**: The goal is to perform object segmentation on images.\
**2 Framework:** As a framework [PyTorch Image Models](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models) was used. It contains models, scripts and pre trained for a lot of state-of-the-art image models within computer vision.\
**3 Data:** We train our model on the [ETH Pedestrian](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/eth) dataset. The testing set contains 1,804 images in three video clips. The dataset is captured from a stereo rig mounted on car, with a resolution of 640 x 480 (bayered), and a framerate of 13--14 FPS. \
**4 Deep Learning model used:**  We used the [Ultralytics YOLOv8 model](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
